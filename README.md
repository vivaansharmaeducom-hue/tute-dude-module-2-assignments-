**task2**

sum of integers 1 to  100 
in this programme i have used for loops to display sum of given integers 
first we give start with total=0 because at the beginning we have not added anything 
the for loop goes thorough each number from 1 up to 100
then num takes one number at a time 
each time the current number (num) is added to (total)
finally total has the full sum of all the numbers
